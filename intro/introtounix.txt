Basic tools:

- ls
  - shows you what's where
  - "-lh" gives you lots of information
  - "-a" shows you hidden files
    - what makes it hidden?

- cd
  - ".." and what it means
  - "." and what it means
  - "-" and why it is awesome.

- pwd
  - "where am i?"

- less
  - How to navigate
  - "Vim" Style, or arrow keys, or space
  - Search with "/"
  - Quit with "q"

- Short break for cool things!
  - Tab Completion!
  - Case Sensitivity

- touch
  - Not particularly useful on its own, but it creates a file see!

- mkdir
  - "-p" is a neat little button

- rm
  - and now we can delete it!
  - '-r' to get through folders
  - '-f' for when you don't want any warnings
  - '-i' is a REALLY good idea.

- mv/cp
  - "-r"
  - multiple move/copy
  - "-i"
  - "~"

- cat 
  - useful every once in a while, although less will be more useful for you

- man
  - Have you read the manpage?  Why not?
  - Pretty much everything comes with a manpage
  - Many sections to a manpage
    - synopsis gives you a quick rundown on syntax
    - Description contains longer description of behavior and syntax.  This is where flags hide.
    - Return Value, Notes, Bugs, Examples, and See Also are also awesome
  - man 3 printf

- history

- grep
  - makes history a little more managable

More useful tricks, to save time and wow your enemies:

 - alias
    - alias gcc="gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic"
    - put it in .bashrc, and always happens
    - alias rm="rm -i"

 - Host files off the CSC servers
    - Did you know that you can host a simple web site off the CSC servers?
      Here's how:
    - create a folder in your home directory called "www"
       - mkdir ~/www
       - also, symlink this folder to public_html, some of the apache modules
         need that
    - Give the webserver (and everyone else!) the ability to traverse into
      your home directory and read into your www folder
       - chmod a+x ~
       - chmod a+rx ~/www
    - Now put an index.html into this folder.  Feel free to copy my template
       - cp ~mgius/www/index_template.html ~/www/index.html
    - Put whatever you like in here. Just make sure that any files you want to
      be visible are readable by everybody (chmod a+r FILENAME), and any 
      folder that you want to be enterable is readable, executable 
      (chmod a+rx FILENAME)
 - Quick Compile things with Make
   - Make is complicated enough to warrant a talk by itself, but you can
     actually use it to compile c programs.
   - make helloworld
   - Make is sensitive to file timestamps, so if your program hasn't been
     updated, it won't waste time recompiling the program.
